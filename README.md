Research project under Dr. David B Massey undertaken jointly with Hunter Sarnelli. Aiming to disprove the Bobadilla conjecture using the invariant defined within [*A New Conjecture, A New Invariant, and a New Non-Splitting Result*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3316.pdf) 

The code contained herein serves two primary purposes: generating polynomials and testing them. As of 9/18/2019, polynomial generation is functionally complete, however it has been proposed that a neural net to optimize finding suitable polynomials constructed through Scikit Learn would be beneficial in increasing sample size. The testing algorithms get into some complex math and have been expanded upon for quite some time, and are the current primary focus. Progress is primarily slowed due to the intricacies of working with [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
