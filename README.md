Research project under Dr. David B Massey undertaken jointly with Hunter Sarnelli. Aiming to disprove the Bobadilla conjecture using the invariant defined within [*A New Conjecture, A New Invariant, and a New Non-Splitting Result*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3316.pdf) 

This program is a CLI application, requiring an installation of Sage MATH that includes Singular. It can be run inside of a Sage MATH terminal interface. Once pasted into the terminal, the various functions can be run, most importantly start(), which allows the user to input parameters for random generation and then testing, testOne('string'), which can test a single polynomial, inputted as a string, and jumpstart() which simply tests parameters preset in the code (largely for development purposes), but which can be used to quickly see the program in action. The program returns polynomials and their lê numbers, which can be used to calculate two thirds of a polynomial's beta invariant. The final piece, the general milnor number, is only experimental and has not yet been fully implemented.

This project has the goal of generating a polynomial with a beta invariant less than 4. The samples that are being used toward this goal come from pseudo-random Python Mersenne Twister-based generation, re-seeded each generation.

Most of the current work focuses on parallelization - which I have found to be quite difficult - and refactoring the code. The general milnor number is currently on hold, as it is fairly easy to do by hand and the lê numbers are a good indicator of polynomial quality.
